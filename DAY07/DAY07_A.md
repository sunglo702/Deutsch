**False reflexive verbs** 

With many verbs that are used in a reflexive way, the reflexive pronoun is an accusative object. In this case, the pronoun can be replaced by another accusative object. These verbs are also known as false reflexive verbs.

**True reflexive verbs**

There are also verbs that can only be reflexive. These are known as true reflexive verbs. True reflexive verbs can be recognized in that the reflexive pronoun may not be omitted or replaced by another pronoun or noun.

Example: **sich** ausruhen

*Nach der Arbeit ruhe ich **mich** aus.*

## Reflexive pronouns (1)

Reflexive verbs have a pronoun that relates to the subject. This pronoun is called the reflexive pronoun. In true reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun is a fixed component of the verb, in non-true reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun is an object.

For the main part, the forms of the reflexive pronoun correspond to those of the personal pronoun. It is only in the third person that the reflexive pronoun has a different form, which is *sich* in both the singular and the plural.

The reflexive pronoun is usually in the accusative, where it has the following forms:

|                 |         | Reflexive pronoun (accusative) |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| ***Ich***       | dusche  | ***mich.***                    |
| ***Du***        | duschst | ***dich.***                    |
| ***Er/Sie/Es*** | duscht  | ***sich.***                    |
| ***Wir***       | duschen | ***uns.***                     |
| ***Ihr***       | duscht  | ***euch.***                    |
| ***Sie***       | duschen | ***sich.***                    |
