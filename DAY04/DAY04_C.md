## Comparison

**Revision: comparative and superlative adjectives**

Adjectives and some adverbs can take different forms that express a higher degree or the highest degree of a characteristic. People and things can be compared in this way. There are three levels of comparison:

The positive is the basic form of the adjective and describes a characteristic.

*Eine kleine Wohnung ist **billig**.*

The comparative compares people or things in terms of this characteristic. It expresses that someone or something possesses a quality to a higher degree.

*Ein Zimmer in einer WG ist **billiger**.*

The superlative expresses that someone or something possesses the highest degree of a quality.

*Ein Zimmer bei den Eltern ist **am billigsten**.*

 

**Regular comparative forms**

We create regular comparative forms like this:

**Positive**: basic form (e.g. *billig*)
**Comparative**: adjective + **-er** (e.g. *billig**er***)
**Superlative**: **am** + adjective +**-sten** (e.g. **am** *billig**sten***)

 

**Comparative forms with umlaut**

Single-syllable adjectives with the vowel *a*, *o* or *u* usually have an umlaut in the comparative and superlative. The adjective *gesund* also belongs to this group even though it has two syllables.

| Form         | Example           |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Positive:    | *warm*            |
| Comparative: | *w**ä**rmer*      |
| Superlative: | *am w**ä**rmsten* |

 

**Superlatives ending in *-esten***

If the adjective ends in *-t*, *-d*, *-s*, *-z*, *-ß*, *-sch* or *-x*, the ending in the superlative is *-***e***sten*. It is easier to pronounce the word because of the added *e*.

 

| Form         | Example           |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Positive:    | *alt*             |
| Comparative: | *älter*           |
| Superlative: | *am ält***e**sten |
